        <p>
          Short answer: the newer business models are officially rated for 64 GB; most 6th–9th generation ones are officially
          rated for 32 GB. &quot;Official&quot; means the manufacturer tested and documented it. It is not a hard ceiling in every
          case: 32 GB SODIMMs became common after many of these machines launched, and owners regularly report 2 × 32 GB kits
          working in models rated for 32 GB.
        </p>
        <h2>Official maximum by model</h2>
        <ModelTable models={byGen} cols={["released", "gen", "ramType", "ram"]} caption="Official RAM limits" />
        <p className="small muted">&quot;(verify)&quot; means we could not confirm every figure against an official document; check the machine type in a listing.</p>
        <h2>What about 64 GB in a 32 GB-rated model?</h2>
        <p>
          Owner reports of 64 GB working are common for the Lenovo M720q/M920q and HP EliteDesk 800 G4/G5, and the model pages
          note it where we have seen it repeatedly. Treat it as unsupported: it can depend on the BIOS version and the specific
          modules, and a vendor will not help if it does not boot. If 64 GB matters, the safer choice is a model that is
          officially rated for it.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips before you buy RAM</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>These use laptop-size SODIMMs. The HP Elite Mini 800 G9 takes DDR5; everything older in this list takes DDR4.</li>
          <li>Install matched pairs for dual-channel bandwidth. A single 32 GB stick works but halves memory bandwidth.</li>
          <li>Faster modules are fine: they run at the platform&apos;s speed (e.g. DDR4-3200 runs at 2666 MT/s in an 8th/9th-gen box).</li>
          <li>Update the BIOS first if you are going above the official limit.</li>

        <p>
          No used 1-litre business PC has 10GbE built in. The reliable way to add it is a low-profile PCIe network card, and only
          a few chassis have a PCIe slot. On the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny models below, the slot comes from an optional riser card
          that sits where the 2.5&quot; drive would go, so you give up that bay.

          <li><strong>The riser and a low-profile bracket.</strong> They are model-specific and almost never included with the PC.</li>
          <li><strong>A low-profile card.</strong> SFP+ cards (with a DAC cable or fibre module) run noticeably cooler than 10GBASE-T (RJ45) cards, which matters in a case this small with one fan.</li>
          <li><strong>Check card length and height</strong> against the space above the riser before you buy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>If your model has no PCIe slot</h2>
        <p>
          HP Elite Mini 800 G9 units can be configured from the factory with an Intel I226-V 2.5GbE port in the Flex IO position.
          For everything else, a USB 3 2.5GbE adapter is the practical option. USB 10GbE adapters exist but cost more than a
          different mini PC and are rarely worth it for a server.

        <p>
          Idle power is the number that matters for a home server, because it sits idle most of the day. It is also the number
          most often guessed. We publish a model&apos;s idle figure only with its source, configuration and method; until then the
          model page says &quot;Not measured yet&quot;. The published readings so far are collected on{" "}
          <Link href="/best/low-power-mini-pc-home-server">the low-power list</Link>.
        </p>
        <h2>What changes idle power</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BIOS power settings:</strong> deep CPU package C-states and PCIe ASPM enabled make the biggest difference. Some ex-office units ship with performance profiles.</li>
          <li><strong>Drives and cards:</strong> each NVMe SSD, 2.5&quot; drive and especially a 10GBASE-T card adds idle draw.</li>
          <li><strong>The operating system:</strong> Linux with <code>powertop --auto-tune</code> applied usually idles lower than a default install.</li>
          <li><strong>The power adapter:</strong> a higher-wattage brick is not less efficient at idle by default, but a failing third-party adapter can be.</li>
          <li><strong>Displays and USB devices:</strong> measure headless if the server will run headless.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to measure it properly</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a plug-in wall meter between the adapter and the socket (this measures what you pay for).</li>
          <li>Boot into the real OS and workload (e.g. Proxmox with your VMs idle) and wait 10 minutes to settle.</li>
          <li>Note the lowest stable reading over a few minutes, plus CPU, RAM, drives, OS, BIOS settings and mains voltage.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Measured one? <Link href="/contact">Send us the reading with those details</Link> and we will add it to the model
          page with credit, labelled as a community measurement.
        </p>
        <h2>From watts to cost</h2>
        <p>
          Yearly energy = watts × 24 × 365 ÷ 1000 kWh. So every 1 W of continuous draw is 8.76 kWh per year. Multiply by your
          electricity price per kWh: for example, a 10 W difference at 0.30 per kWh is about 26 per year in your currency.
        </p>
        <h2>Official sources to check</h2>
        <p>
          Many of these models were ENERGY STAR certified, and the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-computers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ENERGY STAR product finder</a> lists
          an idle-state power figure measured under a standard test for specific certified configurations. It is a useful
          comparison point, but your configuration and OS will differ.

        <p>Proxmox VE runs on almost anything. What decides whether a mini PC is a good node is how many guests it can hold and how you will store them.</p>
        <h2>1. RAM ceiling first</h2>
        <p>RAM runs out before CPU on most home Proxmox hosts. ZFS also uses RAM for its cache. Prefer a model officially rated for 64 GB if you plan many VMs; see <Link href="/guides/do-mini-pcs-support-64gb-ram">which models support 64 GB</Link>.</p>
        <h2>2. A second drive</h2>
        <p>
          Two drives let you mirror the VM storage or keep the OS separate. Two NVMe slots is best; one NVMe plus a 2.5&quot; SATA
          SSD is the common compromise. On Lenovo Tiny models a PCIe riser takes the 2.5&quot; bay, so you cannot have both.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Networking</h2>
        <p>
          One 1 GbE port is enough for a single node. For a cluster with shared storage or live migration, or for an OPNsense VM,
          look at <Link href="/best/mini-pcs-with-faster-than-gigabit-networking">models with a faster or second NIC path</Link>. Intel NICs (I219, I226)
          are well supported by Proxmox&apos;s kernel.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Remote management</h2>
        <p>Intel vPro/AMT on supported CPUs gives you remote console and power control for a headless node, without extra hardware.</p>
        <h2>5. Clusters: three is the magic number</h2>
        <p>
          A Proxmox cluster needs a majority of votes (quorum) to make changes. Three nodes can lose one and keep running; with two
          nodes you need an external QDevice for a third vote. Buying three identical used units also means one set of spare parts.

          The honest answer: a 1-litre PC makes a good small SSD NAS, not a big hard-drive NAS. The most any model here holds is
          three internal drives (two NVMe and one 2.5&quot;), and there is no room for 3.5&quot; hard drives.

          USB drive enclosures work for backups, but they are a compromise for a ZFS or RAID pool: USB bridges can drop drives or
          hide drive health data, which is why TrueNAS and most ZFS guides advise against USB-attached pools. For several hard
          drives, a small tower or a purpose-built NAS is the better tool; a mini PC can still run the apps next to it.

          &quot;TinyMiniMicro&quot; is the homelab nickname (popularised by ServeTheHome) for 1-litre business desktops: Lenovo
          ThinkCentre <em>Tiny</em>, HP EliteDesk/ProDesk <em>Mini</em> and Dell OptiPlex <em>Micro</em>. The names follow patterns
          that tell you the tier and generation.
        </p>
        <h2>Naming patterns</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lenovo:</strong> M7xx models are the value tier and M9xx the business tier (vPro chipsets, more options), e.g. M720q vs M920q. From 2020 Lenovo switched to &quot;Gen&quot; names (M70q Gen 1, M90q Gen 1). The &quot;x&quot; suffix (M920x) marks the extended variant with a second M.2 slot and PCIe option.</li>
          <li><strong>Dell:</strong> OptiPlex 3000-series Micro is the value tier and 7000-series the business tier; the tens digit tracks the generation (7050 → 7060 → 7070 → 7080).</li>
          <li><strong>HP:</strong> ProDesk 400/600 is the value tier and EliteDesk 800 the business tier; G2, G3, G4 … is the generation. From G9 the line is called &quot;Elite Mini 800&quot;.</li>
          <li><strong>AMD versions</strong> have their own names: Lenovo M75q, HP EliteDesk 705.</li>
        </ul>
