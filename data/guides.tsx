        <p>
          The CPU generation decides what a used mini PC can transcode, not the brand or the chassis. The video engine
          inside the processor&apos;s integrated graphics does the work. The key question is whether it can decode the
          formats in your library in hardware.

        <h2>The practical rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6th gen (Skylake), e.g. i5-6500T:</strong> fine for 1080p H.264. It cannot fully decode 10-bit HEVC in hardware, which is what most 4K HDR files use, so those fall back to the CPU and stutter.</li>
          <li><strong>7th–10th gen (Kaby Lake to Comet Lake), e.g. i5-8500T, i5-10500T:</strong> hardware-decode 10-bit HEVC and VP9. This is the sweet spot on price in used 1-litre PCs. No AV1 decode.</li>
          <li><strong>11th gen and newer, e.g. i5-11500T, i5-12500T:</strong> add AV1 decode. Buy this if your library or your sources are moving to AV1.</li>
          <li><strong>AMD Ryzen PRO APUs:</strong> they work with Jellyfin via VA-API, but encoder quality and media-server support are behind Intel Quick Sync. Buy AMD for CPU cores, not for transcoding.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Plex vs Jellyfin</h2>
        <p>
          Plex requires a Plex Pass subscription to use hardware transcoding; Jellyfin supports it for free. Jellyfin&apos;s
          hardware-selection documentation has removed Intel 7th–10th gen from its recommended list because Intel deprecated
          its media toolkit for those generations. They still decode 10-bit HEVC today, but newer generations are the
          longer-term choice.
        </p>
        <h2>Avoid transcoding in the first place</h2>
        <p>
          The best transcode is none at all. If your TVs and phones can play your files directly (&quot;direct play&quot;),
          even an old 6th-gen box works. Transcoding is mostly needed for remote streaming at lower bitrates and for
          clients that do not support HEVC.
        </p>
        <h2>Models by transcoding capability</h2>
        <ul>
          {CATALOG.filter((m) => m.hevc10).map((m) => (
            <li key={m.slug}><Link href={`/models/${m.slug}`}>{m.name}</Link> ({m.cpuList.map((c) => c.name).join(", ")})</li>

    description: "A practical checklist for buying an ex-office ThinkCentre Tiny, OptiPlex Micro or EliteDesk Mini: CPU, RAM, power adapter, drive caddies, BIOS locks and fair prices.",
    updated: "2026-09-25",

    body: () => (
      <>
        <p>Refurbished office mini PCs are cheap because they come by the pallet. Listings are often vague, so the same model can be a bargain or a dud depending on what is actually in the box. Check these before you pay.</p>
        <h2>1. The exact CPU, not &quot;Core i5&quot;</h2>
        <p>An &quot;EliteDesk 800 G3 Mini i5&quot; can be a 6th-gen i5-6500T or a 7th-gen i5-7500T, and only the second hardware-decodes 4K HEVC. Look for the full model number in the title, a photo of the BIOS or System Information screen, or ask the seller.</p>
        <h2>2. RAM: how much, and in how many sticks</h2>
        <p>These machines have two SO-DIMM slots. 16 GB as 2×8 GB leaves no free slot, so upgrading to 32 GB means replacing both sticks. With memory prices high in 2026, a unit that already has 16–32 GB can be worth more than the price difference suggests.</p>
        <h2>3. Is a power adapter included?</h2>
        <p>Many ex-office lots ship without the power brick. Lenovo and HP use proprietary barrel or rectangular connectors, so budget for the correct-wattage adapter if it is missing.</p>
        <h2>4. Storage: what is included, and what is missing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>&quot;No SSD&quot; or &quot;no OS&quot; listings are common and fine if priced accordingly.</li>
          <li>A 2.5&quot; drive needs the caddy and SATA cable. Units that shipped with only an M.2 SSD often lack both.</li>
          <li>Check how many M.2 NVMe slots the model has. The <Link href="/compare/m920q-vs-m920x">M920q vs M920x</Link> mix-up is the classic mistake.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. BIOS and management locks</h2>
        <p>Ex-corporate machines sometimes keep a BIOS administrator password or remote-management settings. Ask the seller to confirm the BIOS is unlocked, and avoid listings that mention a locked BIOS unless you know how to deal with it.</p>
        <h2>6. Expansion parts are sold separately</h2>
        <p>PCIe risers for Lenovo Tiny models and HP Flex IO network modules are almost never included. If you need a second NIC, price the part before choosing the model.</p>
        <h2>7. Judge the price by configuration</h2>
        <p>Compare listings with the same CPU, RAM and storage, and include shipping. Asking prices vary a lot between countries. A <Link href="/alerts">price alert</Link> for your target price saves checking every day.</p>
