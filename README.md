# TinyLab Finder

A finder and comparison site for **used business mini PCs**: Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny, Dell OptiPlex Micro and HP EliteDesk/ProDesk Mini. It's built for people setting up home servers (Proxmox, Plex, Jellyfin, Home Assistant), with **price alerts** for eBay listings.

Why this idea, with sources: [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md).

## What it does
- **Finder** (`/`): filter by brand, 2+ NVMe slots, PCIe expansion, second-NIC option, 64 GB RAM, 4K HEVC / AV1 decode, and CPU vendor. Sort by age, threads or drive bays. Filters live in the URL, so results are shareable.
- **Model pages** (`/models/[slug]`): spec sheet, owner notes, a transcoding table per CPU option, a buying checklist, eBay search links (US/UK/DE), similar models, and a confidence badge.
- **Compare** (`/compare?m=a,b,c`): up to 3 models, with differing rows highlighted. Six curated head-to-heads at `/compare/[pair]` cover pairs people actually ask about on Reddit.
- **Guides**: Quick Sync by generation, and a checklist for checking a used listing.
- **Accounts** (`/signup`, `/verify`, `/login`, `/forgot`, `/account`): name + email + password, confirmed with a 6-digit emailed code. Only price alerts need an account; everything else is open.
- **Price alerts** (`/alerts`): logged-in users get an email when a fixed-price eBay listing is at or under their price; manage alerts on `/account`; one-click unsubscribe in every email.

## Data policy (read before editing `data/models.ts`)
- `confidence: "high"` requires an official source in `sources` (Lenovo PSREF/manual, Dell spec guide, HP service guide); a test enforces this. `"check"` shows a "Verify specs" badge.
- `idleW` stays `null` until someone actually measures it; a test enforces this. Never estimate it.
- Unofficial facts (for example "64 GB works") go in `notes`, never in the official fields.
- Transcoding facts live once per iGPU family in `lib/media.ts`.
- **Status:** 16 of 23 models are verified against official documents. The 7 still marked `check` are listed in docs/RESEARCH.md; verify them before launch.

## Tech stack
- **Next.js 16** (App Router) with React 19 and TypeScript.
  - Pages are statically generated.
  - API routes are only used for alerts.
- **Postgres** stores accounts, sessions and alerts (Supabase in production). The schema lives in `lib/schema.ts` and is applied automatically (idempotent) on first use.
- **Auth** is built in (`lib/auth/`), no third-party auth service:
  - Passwords: scrypt (N=2^14, r=8, p=1) with per-user salt.
  - Email codes: 6 digits, stored as HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `AUTH_SECRET`, 10-minute expiry, locked after 5 wrong tries, 60 s resend cooldown.
  - Sessions: 256-bit random token in an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure cookie; only its SHA-256 is stored; 30-day expiry; password reset signs out every device.
  - Abuse limits (Postgres-backed, so they hold across serverless instances): per-IP limits on signup/login/verify/reset, per-account lock after 8 failed logins in 15 minutes, per-email code limits.
  - CSRF: every state-changing API call requires a same-site `Origin` and a JSON body.
  - No account discovery through "forgot password" or code resends.
- **eBay Browse API** supplies active listings.
- **Resend** sends email (plain HTTP, no SDK).
- **Scheduled price check:** a Vercel Cron job (or any external scheduler) calls `/api/cron/check-prices`.
- **Hosting:** fits Vercel's free or low tiers. It's also a standard `next start` app, so any Node host works.

## Local development
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # every variable is optional locally
npm run dev                       # http://localhost:3000
npm test                          # unit tests
npm run lint                      # TypeScript type-check
npm run build && npm start        # production build
```
To see ad placements while designing, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADS_PROVIDER=placeholder`.

## Environment variables
See `.env.example`.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`** values are public and baked in at build time, so **rebuild after changing them**.
- **Server-only secrets:** `DATABASE_URL`, `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `CRON_SECRET`.

## Production deployment (Vercel)
1. Import the repository into Vercel.
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your domain and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` to your address.
3. **Database (Supabase project `tinylab-finder`, us-east-1, already created, with the `alerts` table and row-level security set up):**
   - In Supabase, open **Connect → Transaction pooler** and copy the URI (port 6543). Put your database password into it and set it as `DATABASE_URL`.
   - Go to **Settings → Database → SSL Configuration → Download certificate** and paste the PEM into `DATABASE_CA_CERT`, so the connection is encrypted and verified.
   - The table has RLS on with no policies, so Supabase's public REST API can't read it. Only the server, using the database password, can.
4. **eBay:** create a production keyset at developer.ebay.com, then set `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` and `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. **Email:** verify your domain in Resend, then set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM`.
6. **Cron:** set `CRON_SECRET` to a long random string. `vercel.json` runs the check once a day at 06:17 UTC (the most often Vercel's free Hobby plan allows; on Pro you can shorten it to every 6 hours), and Vercel sends the secret as a Bearer token.
7. **Domain:** in Vercel's Domains settings, add the domain and create the DNS records it shows you.
8. **Search Console:** submit `https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console.

On any other host, run `npm run build && npm start` and call `/api/cron/check-prices` with the header `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` on a schedule.

## Analytics
Analytics are cookieless (no consent banner needed for them).
- **Plausible:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS=plausible` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN`.
- **Umami:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS=umami`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SRC`.

Tracked events (no personal data):
- `filter_change`
- `compare_add`
- `compare_view`
- `listing_click`
- `alert_created`

Traffic sources, top pages, returning visitors and search traffic come from the provider dashboard. Connect Search Console for search queries.

## AdSense setup (after approval; approval is not guaranteed)
1. **Apply first.** Apply once the site has real traffic and the specs are verified. Google requires original, valuable content, and thin or unverified pages hurt approval.
2. **Configure the environment:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADS_PROVIDER=adsense` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT=ca-pub-…`.
   - `/ads.txt` is then generated automatically.
3. **Create ad units.** Create responsive display units in AdSense and put their IDs in:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_SLOT_IN_CONTENT`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_SLOT_SIDEBAR`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_SLOT_BELOW_RESULTS`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_SLOT_FOOTER` (optional)

   A placement with no ID renders nothing.
4. **Consent (EEA/UK/Switzerland).** In AdSense, go to **Privacy & messaging** and publish Google's certified consent message for those regions. It's served by the AdSense script, so no code change is needed.
5. **Rebuild and redeploy.**

**How the ad system behaves:**
- Ads are off by default.
- Every ad is labelled "Advertisement" and kept apart from content and navigation.
- Space is reserved in advance to avoid layout shift.
- The sidebar ad appears on desktop only.
- There are no ads on the alert-confirmation, unsubscribe or error pages.

**Adding another ad network:** add it to `AdProvider` in `components/ads/AdConfig.ts` and write a renderer in `AdSlot.tsx`.

## Other monetization already wired up
- **eBay Partner Network:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_EPN_CAMPAIGN_ID`. Links then become `rel="sponsored"` and show a disclosure.
- **Possible paid tier for alerts:** more alerts per email (the limit is 5 today), more marketplaces, sold-price history. Sold-price history needs eBay Marketplace Insights API approval.

## Testing done
- Unit tests: 14 passing (includes password hashing, code binding, session tokens, redirect safety).
- Auth end-to-end (Playwright + real Postgres): signup → wrong/right code → alert → account → delete → logout → login → forgot/reset (other devices signed out), plus CSRF, brute-force lock, login lockout, no account discovery.
- Browser tests (Playwright, 390px mobile and 1366px desktop): 66/66 checks passing. They covered:
  - Filtering, URL state and the empty state.
  - Compare flow and the alert form, including client validation, the success path and a simulated API failure.
  - Ad slots: labelled, space reserved, sidebar desktop-only.
  - No horizontal scrolling and no console errors.
  - SEO: title, description, canonical, og:image, exactly one h1 and JSON-LD on each page type.
  - A crawl of 39 internal pages found no broken links.
- API behaviour checked: 400, 422, 201, 429, confirm redirect, unsubscribe (including a repeat), and cron returning 401 without the secret and 503 without eBay keys.
